You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

In the above code, we have the main.py file which initializes the game and starts the game loop. It imports the Tetris class from the tetris.py file and creates an instance of it. The main function is called to start the game.

The tetris.py file contains the Tetris class which represents the game logic. It initializes the game window, grid, current and next pieces, and score. The run method is the game loop where the update and draw methods will be called. Currently, the update and draw methods are empty and need to be implemented.

Please note that the code provided is just a starting point and needs to be expanded upon to fully implement the Tetris game.

6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Piece` class is not imported in the `tetris.py` file. To fix this, you need to add the import statement `from tetris import Piece` at the top of the `tetris.py` file.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the methods in the `Tetris` class to explain their purpose and functionality. This will improve code readability and make it easier for others to understand the code.

Here is the revised `tetris.py` file with the necessary import statement and added comments:

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Piece` class is not imported in the `tetris.py` file. To fix this, you need to add the import statement `from tetris import Piece` at the top of the `tetris.py` file.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the methods in the `Tetris` class to explain their purpose and functionality. This will improve code readability and make it easier for others to understand the code.

Here is the revised `tetris.py` file with the necessary import statement and added comments:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create Tetris.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Piece` class in `tetris.py` is importing itself, which will cause a circular import error. To fix this, you need to update the import statement in `tetris.py` to import the `Piece` class from a different module or file.

<Suggestion>
In `tetris.py`, update the import statement for the `Piece` class as follows:
```python
from piece import Piece
```

Also, make sure to create a new file called `piece.py` and move the `Piece` class definition to that file. Then, import the `Piece` class from `piece.py` in `tetris.py` as mentioned above.

Once you have made these changes, the circular import error will be resolved.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Piece` class in `tetris.py` is importing itself, which will cause a circular import error. To fix this, you need to update the import statement in `tetris.py` to import the `Piece` class from a different module or file.

<Suggestion>
In `tetris.py`, update the import statement for the `Piece` class as follows:
```python
from piece import Piece
```

Also, make sure to create a new file called `piece.py` and move the `Piece` class definition to that file. Then, import the `Piece` class from `piece.py` in `tetris.py` as mentioned above.

Once you have made these changes, the circular import error will be resolved."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create Tetris.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Piece` class in `piece.py` is not imported in `tetris.py`, which leads to an error when trying to create a new instance of `Piece` in the `Tetris` class. To fix this, you need to import the `Piece` class in `tetris.py` by adding the following line at the top of the file:

```python
from piece import Piece
```

Once you make this change, the code should work correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Piece` class in `piece.py` is not imported in `tetris.py`, which leads to an error when trying to create a new instance of `Piece` in the `Tetris` class. To fix this, you need to import the `Piece` class in `tetris.py` by adding the following line at the top of the file:

```python
from piece import Piece
```

Once you make this change, the code should work correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To create a requirements.txt file for the Tetris project, we need to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. Based on the provided code, it seems that the project only requires the Pygame library.
Here is the requirements.txt file for the Tetris project:
requirements.txt
```
pygame==2.0.1
```
This file specifies that the project requires Pygame version 2.0.1. You can use this file to install the required dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the specified version of Pygame and any other dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
